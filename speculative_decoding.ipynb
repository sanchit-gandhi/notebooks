        "Open AI's [Whisper](https://huggingface.co/collections/openai/whisper-release-6501bba2cf999715fd953013) is a general purpose speech transcription model that achieves state-of-the-art results across a range of different benchmarks and audio conditions. The latest [large-v3](https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-large-v3) model tops the [OpenASR Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/hf-audio/open_asr_leaderboard), ranking as the best open-source speech transcription model for English. The model also demonstrates strong multilingual performance, acheiving less than 30% word error rate (WER) on 42 of the 58 languages tested in the Common Voice 15 dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "While the transcription accuracy is exceptional, the inference time is very slow. A 1 hour audio clip takes upwards of 6 minutes to transcribe on a 16GB T4 GPU, even after leveraging inference optimisations like [flash attention](https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-large-v3#flash-attention), half-precision and chunking. In this Google Colab, we demonstrate how Speculative Decoding can be employed to reduce the inference time of Whisper by a **factor of 2**, while mathematically ensuring exactly the **same outputs** are achieved from the model. As a result, this method provides a perfect drop-in replacement for existing Whisper pipelines, since it provides free 2x speed-up while maintaining the same accuracy."

Furthermore, the verification forward passes performed by the main model ensure that **exactly the same outputs** are achieved as using the main model standalone. This makes speculative decoding the perfect substitute to existing Whisper pipelines, since one can be certain that the same performance will be attained.\n",

In practice, these two attributes form a trade-off: the faster the model is, the less accurate it is. The only constraint for selecting an assistant model is that it must share the same vocabulary as the main model. That is to say, if we want to use speculative decoding with Whisper [large-v2](https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-large-v2) (multilingual), we need to select a multilingual variant of Whisper. Whereas if we want to use speculative decoding with Whisper [medium.en](https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-medium.en) (English-only), we need an English-only variant of Whisper. At the current time, Whisper [large-v3](https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-large-v3) is an exception, since it is the only Whisper checkpoint with an expanded vocabulary size, and thus is not compatible with previous Whisper checkpoints.\n",

To use speculative decoding for multilingual speech transcription, one could either use on of the [official multilingual Whisper checkpoints](https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-large-v2#model-details), or a fine-tuned variant of Whisper. As of the time of writing, there are over 5,000 [fine-tuned Whisper checkpoints](https://huggingface.co/models?other=whisper) on the Hugging Face Hub in over 100 languages.

        "It is worth noting that the largest speed gains with speculative decoding come with a batch size of 1. For batched speculative decoding, all candidate tokens **across the batch** must match the validation tokens in order for the tokens to be accepted. If a token in the batch at a given position does not agree, all candidate tokens that precede the position are discarded. Consequently, speculative decoding favours lower batch sizes. In practice, we find that speculative decoding provides a speed-up until a batch size of 4. Above batch size 4, speculative decoding returns slower inference than the main model alone. For full results, refer to Section D.3 (page 28) of the [Distil-Whisper paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.00430.pdf)."
